<h2> Training vs. Validation Accuracy (Initial Approach)
This plot shows the accuracy of the model on the training and validation sets over 10 epochs. The model demonstrates strong performance on the training data but poor and unstable accuracy on the validation set, indicating overfitting. This is an initial approach, and further improvements will be made to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization.</h2>
